However, it omits additional contextual details such as the black walls or the specific room setting (restroom stall or small room), which are mentioned in some of the ground truths. The caption is mostly relevant and includes key attributes, but lacks full completeness to match the richness of the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A bathroom toilet with a shiny seat cover\" is moderately relevant to the ground truth captions. It correctly identifies the presence of a bathroom toilet and mentions a shiny seat cover, which aligns with the idea of a toilet with glitter or silver paint on the seat. However, it lacks specific details such as the color of the walls, the presence of black walls or splatter paint, and the overall description of the restroom environment. The caption is understandable and captures some key elements but is incomplete compared to the rich details in the ground truth captions.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a \"sparkly toilet bowl lid and seat cover,\" which aligns with the descriptions of glitter or silver paint on the toilet in the ground truth captions. However, it incorrectly infers the setting as \"likely from a jewelry store,\" which is not supported by any of the ground truths. The captions describe a restroom or small room with specific visual characteristics, not a jewelry store. While the caption captures some key visual elements, the inaccurate contextual inference and omission of important details (e.g., black walls, splatter paint, small room) prevent it from being fully aligned with the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A toilet with a shiny lid up\" is somewhat relevant to the ground truth captions, which all describe a toilet with unusual or decorative features such as glitter, paint, or a silver seat. The phrase \"shiny lid up\" captures the idea of a decorative or reflective surface on the toilet lid, which is consistent with some of the ground truth descriptions involving glitter and silver. However, the caption lacks many specific details present in the ground truth, such as the color of the paint, the black walls, or the small room context. It is moderately relevant and includes some key elements, but it is not detailed or comprehensive enough to align closely with the full set of ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a bucket on a stool next to a toilet, which aligns with several ground truth captions that describe a small bucket or containers on a stool in a bathroom near the toilet. However, it omits some key details present in the ground truth, such as the color of the bucket (red or orange), the presence of a shower or tiled walls, and the mention of plumbing drips. While the general scene and some key elements are captured, the caption lacks the richness and specificity seen in the ground truth set.  \nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions an orange bucket on a stool next to a toilet, which aligns with several of the ground truth captions. It captures the main object (orange bucket), its location (on a stool), and its placement relative to a toilet. However, it omits other key elements present in the ground truths, such as the presence of an open shower, tiled bathroom, and the mention of containers catching plumbing drips. While the caption is mostly relevant and detailed, it misses some important contextual elements.\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption is mostly relevant and includes several key elements present in the ground truth captions. It mentions a bucket on a stool next to a toilet, which aligns with multiple ground truths. However, it adds the detail that the bucket is \"plastic\" and \"filled with a dirty liquid,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in any of the ground truths. While this detail could be plausible, it introduces information not present in the reference descriptions. The caption also omits other elements like the presence of a shower or the mention of plumbing drips in some ground truths. Despite these minor inaccuracies or omissions, the caption captures the main idea and includes relevant attributes and relationships. \n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a toilet and a bucket, which are key elements present in several ground truth captions. However, it adds the detail of the bucket \"of water,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truths. Additionally, it omits other important elements such as the tiled bathroom, the stool, and the presence of plumbing drips. While the general idea is captured, the caption lacks completeness and some inaccuracies are present. Therefore, it is mostly relevant but misses key supporting details.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a parking lot filled with cars, which is consistent with several of the ground truth captions. However, it introduces a \"shopping center in the background,\" which is not mentioned in any of the ground truths. The ground truths emphasize the view from an airplane or a jetliner wing, which is a key contextual element that is completely missing from the generated caption. While the parking lot and cars are captured, the omission of the aerial perspective and the addition of a shopping center detract from the overall alignment with the ground truths. Therefore, the caption is moderately relevant but lacks important contextual details.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption is mostly relevant and includes key elements from the ground truth captions. It mentions the presence of a parking lot full of cars and the wing of a plane, which are both central to the ground truths. However, it inaccurately describes the plane as \"taking off from the runway\" when the ground truths do not mention a runway or takeoff. Additionally, it adds details (like \"airport\") not explicitly present in the ground truths. While the caption is detailed and captures the main idea, the inaccuracies and added details prevent it from being a perfect match.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A parking area for vehicles in front of an airport\" captures the general concept of a parking area, which is consistent with the ground truth captions. However, it completely misses the key detail that the perspective is from an airplane or jetliner wing, which is a central element in all the ground truth descriptions. The generated caption is generic and lacks the specific context and viewpoint that the ground truths emphasize. While it is not irrelevant, it lacks sufficient detail and relevance to the main idea conveyed by the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 2",

    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the general idea of a small bathroom with a toilet and a shower, which is consistent with the ground truth captions. However, it introduces a \"sink,\" which is not mentioned in any of the ground truth captions, and it describes the shower as a \"walk-in shower,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truths. The ground truth captions emphasize the compactness of the bathroom and the presence of a chained or circular shower stall, as well as the absence of part of the toilet in one caption. The generated caption lacks these specific details and attributes, making it somewhat generic. It is moderately relevant but misses key elements and has minor inaccuracies.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption correctly identifies the key elements of the scene: a bathroom, a toilet, and a blue tiled shower with a metal showerhead. It aligns with several ground truth captions, such as the presence of a toilet and a shower in a bathroom. However, it does not mention the chained shower (as in some ground truths), nor does it capture the compact or stylish nature of the bathroom or the detail about the blue painted walls and the missing upper half of the toilet in some of the ground truths. The caption is mostly accurate and detailed but lacks some of the finer or more specific elements described in the ground truths. \n\nTotal rating: 4",

It correctly identifies the presence of a toilet and a shower in a bathroom setting, which is consistent with most of the ground truth descriptions. However, it lacks specific details such as the compactness of the bathroom, the style of the shower (e.g., circular or chained), the blue paint, and the missing upper half of the toilet. These omissions prevent it from being highly detailed or fully aligned with the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
