    "Evaluation: The generated caption correctly identifies a vintage red and white airplane sitting on an airport runway, which aligns with several ground truth captions that mention a white and red plane on the ground or tarmac. However, it only refers to a single airplane, whereas several of the ground truth captions mention two airplanes or a pair of planes, such as the P-51 Mustang and B-25 Mitchell. The generated caption is moderately relevant and includes some key details but misses the dual-plane aspect that is central to most of the ground truth descriptions. It is informative but incomplete.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A small airplane\" is extremely vague and lacks almost all relevant details present in the ground truth captions. While it does mention the general presence of a small airplane, it omits key elements such as the presence of a second airplane, the specific types of planes (P-51 Mustang and B-25 Mitchell), their colors (white and red, grey), the airport tarmac or airstrip setting, and the cones mentioned in one of the ground truths. The caption is too minimal and does not reflect the richness or specific information in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 2"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Bike and a table and chairs outside of a building\" is somewhat relevant to the ground truth captions, as it mentions a bike and outdoor seating (table and chairs), which are present in several of the ground truth descriptions. However, it lacks significant detail and context. It does not capture the presence of multiple bikes, the sidewalk, the fish-eye perspective, or the people gathering mentioned in the ground truths. The caption is generic and misses key elements and relationships described in the ground truths, making it only moderately informative.\n\nTotal rating: 3",

Additionally, it introduces a man, which is not mentioned in any of the ground truths. The caption is moderately informative but lacks completeness and misses several important contextual elements.  \nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the key elements of the scene described in the ground truth captions: bicycles parked on the sidewalk and people sitting outside a restaurant. It aligns with multiple ground truths, such as \"A sidewalk next to the outdoor sitting area of a restaurant\" and \"Bicycles and vehicles are parked where people are gathered.\" However, it lacks some specific details present in the ground truths, such as the mention of a fish eye shot, umbrellas, or the black and white photo aspect. While the caption is mostly accurate and includes relevant attributes, it omits some finer contextual details.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption is moderately relevant and captures the general idea that people are outside a restaurant with bikes, chairs, and umbrellas. This aligns with several elements from the ground truth captions, such as the outdoor sitting area of a restaurant, the presence of bikes on the sidewalk, and the mention of umbrellas. However, it lacks specific details such as the fish-eye shot or the black and white photo style mentioned in the ground truths, and it does not fully capture the context of vehicles or the crowded nature of the scene. The caption is understandable and includes some key elements, but it misses finer details and relationships present in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption partially captures the general idea of the ground truth captions by mentioning two women sitting together and one using a laptop. However, it completely omits the key detail of smoking cigarettes, which is a central element in all the ground truth captions. Additionally, it introduces the detail of \"glasses,\" which is not mentioned in any of the ground truths. While the setting is somewhat inferred as being outside (from the ground truths), it is not explicitly stated in the generated caption. The caption lacks sufficient detail and misses a major aspect of the scene (smoking), which limits its alignment with the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",

    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A green pot with a green lid\" is completely irrelevant to the ground truth captions, which all describe a variety of bottles, glasses, and utensils arranged in or near a kitchen setting, specifically behind a stove or in a sink.

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a bottle of water and a cup (glass), which are present in several ground truth captions. However, it incorrectly places them on a \"kitchen counter\" rather than \"behind a stove\" or \"behind a burner on a stove\" as described in the ground truths. The location is a key contextual detail that is missed, and the caption omits the presence of utensils or containers, which are mentioned in multiple ground truths.
