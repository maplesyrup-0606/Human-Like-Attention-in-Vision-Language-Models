    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the main idea of a group of people riding motorcycles and mopeds, which is consistent with several of the ground truth captions. It also mentions \"in front of a tall tree,\" which is a relevant detail present in some of the ground truths. However, the generated caption lacks the detail about the street or the tree-lined environment that is emphasized in the ground truths. It is somewhat generic and misses the broader context of the setting (e.g., a long street filled with trees or a park). Therefore, it is moderately relevant but not fully detailed.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the general idea of a group of people riding motorcycles on a street, which is consistent with several of the ground truth captions. However, it lacks specific details present in the ground truths, such as the presence of tall trees or the setting being a park or tree-lined street. Additionally, it does not distinguish between motorcycles and scooters/mopeds, which are mentioned in the ground truths. The caption is informative but misses key contextual elements and specific relationships described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a bus turning a corner in a city, which is somewhat aligned with the general theme of city transportation present in the ground truth captions. However, it does not mention the trolley or electric bus aspect, which is central to the ground truths. Additionally, the specific detail of \"bus number 141\" is not present in any of the ground truth captions, and the action of turning a corner is not a common or emphasized action in the provided references. The caption lacks alignment with the key elements (electric trolley, Seattle, building in the background, etc.) and misses important context, making it only moderately relevant.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption is completely irrelevant to the ground truth captions. It mentions a \"traffic light\" and a \"train coming out of the station,\" which are not described in any of the ground truth captions. The actual focus of the ground truths is on a trolley or electric trolley bus moving along a city street with a building in the background, typically in Seattle. The generated caption lacks any reference to these key elements and instead introduces unrelated concepts. As such, it fails to capture the overall meaning or any specific detail from the ground truth descriptions.\n\nTotal rating: 1",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the main subject (a tram) and its location (in the street near a building), which aligns with several of the ground truth captions. It also adds specific detail (white and blue color, number 141) that is not present in the ground truths but is plausible. However, it does not explicitly mention the city (Seattle), the trolley's electric nature, or the car passing it in one of the ground truths. While it is mostly relevant and includes several key elements, it misses some important contextual details mentioned in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a \"train on track\" which is not accurate given that the ground truth captions all describe a **trolley bus**, not a train. Additionally, while the generated caption mentions a \"street with trees and cars nearby,\" it lacks specific details such as the city (Seattle), the electric nature of the trolley, and the presence of a building or hotel in the background, which are mentioned in several ground truth captions. The generated caption captures a general sense of a vehicle on a street, but it misidentifies the vehicle type and omits key contextual elements. Therefore, it is moderately relevant but lacks completeness and accuracy.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption introduces elements (a man riding a moped, a dog wearing a helmet) that are not present in any of the ground truth captions. The ground truth captions consistently describe a street scene involving a person on a motorcycle interacting with others at a farmers or veggie/fruit market, specifically involving a watermelon. The generated caption lacks these key elements and introduces irrelevant characters and objects. As a result, it is not aligned with the overall meaning of the ground truth captions.\n\nTotal rating: 1",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a motor scooter and fruit, which are relevant to the ground truth captions. However, it does not accurately capture the specific interactions described in the ground truths, such as a person on a motorcycle talking to someone with a watermelon or a woman showing a watermelon slice. The generated caption is somewhat vague and omits key relationships and specific details present in the ground truths. It captures a general idea of the scene but lacks the necessary richness and alignment with the detailed interactions in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a man on a moped and a motorcycle on the street with many people, which is somewhat related to the ground truth captions that describe a street scene involving a motorcycle and people at a market. However, it omits key details such as the watermelon, the interaction between the individuals, and the specific context of a farmers/veggie market. The caption is somewhat generic and misses several important elements present in the ground truths. It captures the general idea of a street scene with a motorcycle and people but lacks the finer details that are essential to the ground truth descriptions.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes \"a person on a moped petting a white dog,\" which is not aligned with any of the ground truth captions. The ground truth captions describe a scene involving a person on a motorcycle, a farmers market, and interactions involving a watermelon and fruit/veggie market. The generated caption introduces a moped (which is not mentioned in any ground truth), a white dog (also not present in any ground truth), and an action (petting) that is unrelated to the interactions described in the ground truths. Therefore, the generated caption is completely irrelevant to the actual content described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 1"
