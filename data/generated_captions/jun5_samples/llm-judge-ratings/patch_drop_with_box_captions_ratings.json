    "Evaluation: The generated caption accurately describes the cat being curled up in a bowl and mentions its gray color, which aligns with multiple ground truth captions. However, it introduces an additional detail (\"next to a green toy\") that is not mentioned in any of the ground truth captions, and it omits the context of the wooden table or the floor mentioned in some of the ground truths. While the core elements are captured well, the addition of the toy is a minor inaccuracy, and the lack of context (table vs. ground) slightly reduces its alignment with the full set of ground truths. Overall, it is mostly relevant and detailed.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption introduces elements not mentioned in the ground truth captions, specifically \"wrapped in blankets\" and \"cat bed.\" These details are not present in any of the ground truth captions, which consistently describe a cat sleeping in a bowl or tin. While the generated caption is somewhat relevant (a cat sleeping), it misses the key object (the bowl or tin) and introduces incorrect contextual details. The caption is generic and lacks alignment with the specific details in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption correctly identifies the cat as curled up and with its eyes closed, which aligns with the general theme of the cat sleeping or resting, as described in the ground truth captions. However, it fails to mention the key object\u2014the bowl or tin\u2014that is consistently referenced in the ground truth descriptions. Instead, it inaccurately describes the cat as \"laying on a green surface or a small rug,\" which does not match the actual setting described in the ground truths. While the caption is somewhat relevant and includes a few accurate details, it lacks the key elements that define the scene in the ground truths, making it only moderately relevant.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions two giraffes standing together, which is partially consistent with the ground truth captions. However, it fails to capture the key detail that one of the giraffes is in the process of getting up or is crouched down, as described in the ground truth. The generated caption also omits the context of one giraffe looking from behind shrubs or in the grass. While the mention of two giraffes is correct, the overall meaning and key actions described in the ground truth are not captured. This places the caption in the \"Moderately Relevant and Informative\" category.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption is completely irrelevant to the ground truth captions. The ground truths describe two giraffes in various postures related to sitting, standing, or getting up from the ground, often in a grassy or shrub-filled environment. The generated caption, however, describes the giraffes as \"eating leaves with their heads high above the ground,\" which is a different action and posture not reflected in any of the ground truths. The caption introduces an activity (eating) and a position (heads high) that are not consistent with the descriptions in the ground truths. It lacks alignment with the key elements described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 1",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions \"two adult giraffes standing side by side in a field,\" which is only partially aligned with the ground truth captions. While it correctly identifies the presence of two giraffes, it misrepresents their posture\u2014most ground truth captions describe one giraffe as sitting, crouched, or in the process of standing up, while the other observes. The generated caption omits these key details and inaccurately states they are both standing. It also lacks any mention of the shrubs, grass, or the interaction between the two giraffes described in the ground truth. The caption is somewhat relevant but lacks critical detail and misrepresents the scene.\n\nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Two giraffes are standing next to each other\" is somewhat relevant to the ground truth captions, as it correctly identifies that there are two giraffes and mentions that they are standing. However, it misses key details that are consistently described in the ground truths\u2014such as one giraffe being in the process of standing up or crouched down, and the other observing from behind shrubs. The generated caption is overly simplified and omits the important postural and contextual elements described in the ground truths. As a result, it only partially captures the overall meaning and lacks the necessary detail to be considered mostly or highly relevant.\n\nTotal rating: 3"
