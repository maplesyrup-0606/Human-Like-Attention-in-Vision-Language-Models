The ground truths consistently describe people, particularly men, sitting on benches and reading newspapers or relaxing outside. The generated caption completely omits the key elements of sitting, benches, and reading a newspaper. It introduces unrelated details that are not supported by the ground truths, making it irrelevant to the actual content described in the ground truth captions.\n\nTotal rating: 1",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes a man in a suit walking past multiple metal benches along a street, which is only loosely related to the ground truth captions. The ground truth captions focus on people **sitting** on benches, often reading a newspaper, and emphasize a **relaxing outdoor scene**. In contrast, the generated caption describes a **passing man** and benches that are **not occupied**, which omits the key elements of people sitting and reading. While it mentions benches and a public space, it lacks alignment with the main actions and context described in the ground truths. It is somewhat relevant but misses most of the important details.\n\nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions \"a group of people\" and \"a bench,\" which aligns with the general idea present in several ground truth captions. However, it lacks specific details such as the presence of newspapers, the act of reading, and the description of the setting (e.g., \"outside\" is mentioned, but the ground truths emphasize a relaxing or sunny outdoor environment). The caption is somewhat generic and omits key elements present in the ground truths, such as reading the newspaper or the shade mentioned in some descriptions. Therefore, it is moderately relevant but not detailed enough to capture the full essence of the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a counter with two sinks and soap, which partially aligns with some elements in the ground truth captions (e.g., sinks, bathroom context). However, it omits key components like the tub, mirror, and the clean hotel setting that are frequently mentioned in the ground truths. Additionally, the caption is somewhat generic and lacks specific alignment with the richness of the ground truth descriptions. It captures a part of the scene but misses the overall context and important elements.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A bathroom with a sink and counter\" is moderately relevant to the ground truth captions, as it captures the general setting (a bathroom) and mentions a key object (a sink). It also adds a \"counter,\" which is a reasonable inference and aligns with the mention of a \"bathroom vanity\" in one of the ground truths. However, it lacks detail and misses several important elements such as the presence of a tub, the mirror, the bottles on the vanity, and the clean hotel context. The caption is understandable and partially accurate but lacks the richness and completeness to score higher.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a bathroom sink, which is a key element present in several of the ground truth captions. However, it only includes a minimal detail (two cups on the sink) and omits other important elements like the mirror, tub, bathroom vanity, and the overall context of a clean hotel bathroom. The caption is somewhat relevant but lacks the richness and completeness of the ground truth descriptions.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A bathroom sink with a vanity below it\" captures the general idea of a bathroom setting and mentions a sink and a vanity, which are both present in several ground truth captions. However, it lacks many of the additional details found in the ground truths, such as the presence of a tub, the clean hotel setting, or the numerous bottles on the vanity. While the caption is understandable and moderately relevant, it is incomplete and misses several key elements described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions the presence of a sink and a toilet, which are key elements found in most of the ground truth captions. However, it lacks detail and does not capture other important components such as the vanity, mirror, overhead light, or tub that are mentioned in the ground truth. The caption is somewhat relevant and captures a basic understanding of the scene, but it is missing significant details that are present in the ground truth descriptions.  \nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions three key elements found in the ground truth captions: the sink, toilet, and shower (which is similar to the tub mentioned in one of the ground truths). However, it omits several important details such as the vanity, mirror, overhead light, and the description of the bathroom as \"ugly.\" While it captures the general idea of a bathroom with key fixtures, it lacks the richness and completeness of the ground truth descriptions. It is informative but misses several relevant attributes and relationships described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A bathroom with a sink and a mirror above it\" is moderately relevant to the ground truth captions. It captures the presence of a bathroom and two key elements: a sink and a mirror. However, it omits several other important elements described in the ground truth, such as the toilet, the vanity, the overhead light, and the tub. The caption is understandable and includes some relevant details, but it lacks completeness and misses finer elements that are emphasized in the ground truth descriptions.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the main elements of the scene (bathroom, sink, mirror, toilet) and correctly identifies it as a \"small hotel bathroom,\" which aligns with several ground truth captions. However, it omits some key details mentioned in the ground truths, such as the vanity's placement, the presence of a tub, and the overhead light. While it is informative and moderately detailed, it lacks the completeness and richer context that would justify a higher score.  \nTotal rating: 3"
