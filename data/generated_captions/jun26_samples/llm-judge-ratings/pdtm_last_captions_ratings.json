    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Bird perching on a branch of a tree\" provides a very minimal and generic description of the scene. While it correctly identifies the presence of a bird, it omits all the detailed visual characteristics (such as color patterns, beak shape, and body markings) that are emphasized in the ground truth captions. The ground truth captions describe a small bird with a variety of color combinations (brown, tan, black, white, orange, yellow, grey), specific markings (stripes, speckles, crowns), and beak types (short, stubby, pointy). The generated caption fails to capture any of these attributes and only mentions a basic action (perching) and location (branch of a tree), which is not present in the ground truths. Therefore, the generated caption is minimally relevant and lacks detail.\n\nTotal rating: 2",
