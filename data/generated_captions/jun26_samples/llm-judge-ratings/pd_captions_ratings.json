The caption is also speculative (e.g., \"likely a mallard\") and lacks the richness and specificity found in the ground truth descriptions. While it is somewhat relevant, it is too vague and misses most key details.\n\nTotal rating: 2",

While it does imply a large bird on water, which is consistent with some of the ground truth descriptions (e.g., \"a large bird swimming in water with a white throat and chest\"), it completely omits nearly all the detailed attributes described in the ground truths, such as color patterns (white, gray, brown, black), beak shape (long, thin, pointed), and specific features like the crown, neck, and wing patterns.

The generated caption incorrectly identifies the bird as black and white, which is not supported by any of the ground truth descriptions.
