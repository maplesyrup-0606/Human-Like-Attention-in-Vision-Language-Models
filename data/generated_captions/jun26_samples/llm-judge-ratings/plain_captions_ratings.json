However, it omits many other important details such as the presence of white cheek patches, the specific beak shape (pointy, curved), the body color (gray, blueish, etc.), and the overall structure of the bird (large, etc.). While it captures some correct elements, it lacks completeness and misses several key attributes that are consistently mentioned across the ground truth captions.
