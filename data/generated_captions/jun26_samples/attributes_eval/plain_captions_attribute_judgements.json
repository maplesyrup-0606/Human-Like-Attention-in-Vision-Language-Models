It also fails to capture the bird's size, posture, or any of the color combinations on different body parts.

The mention of \"yellow\" is present in the ground truth, but it is not described in the context of the bird's features (e.g., \"yellow wing\" or \"yellow breast\"), so it cannot be considered a true positive."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 45\n```\n\n**Reason:**\nThe generated caption (\"A bird sits in a tree surrounded by green leaves and bushes.\") provides a very general and vague description of a bird in a natural setting. It does not mention any of the specific attributes listed in the ground truth, such as color details (e.g., grey wings, yellow underparts), patterns (e.g., multi-colored breast, tail), shape features (e.g., notched tail, all-purpose bill), or size and shape (e.g., very small, perching-like). Therefore, there are no true positives, and all 45 ground truth attributes are considered false negatives. Since the caption does not include any additional attributes beyond what is in the ground truth, there are no false positives.",

All mentioned attributes (yellow, gray, perching) are indeed part of the ground truth.\n\n- **False Negatives (43):**\n  - The caption is very brief and omits nearly all of the detailed attributes provided in the ground truth. These include descriptions of bill shape and length, multiple color attributes for different body parts (e.g., underparts, breast, belly, tail), patterns, eye color, leg color, and more. The caption fails to capture the richness and specificity of the bird's appearance as described in the ground truth.\n\nIn summary, while the caption captures a couple of key attributes, it is highly incomplete and lacks the detailed description provided in the ground truth.",

    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 27\n```\n\n**Reason for the results:**\n\n- **True Positives (1):** The caption correctly mentions that the bird is \"black,\" which aligns with the ground truth that has multiple attributes specifying black coloration (e.g., `has_upperparts_color::black`, `has_underparts_color::black`, etc.). However, since the color black is a single attribute mentioned in the caption and corresponds to a general color attribute in the ground truth, it is counted as one true positive.\n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption mentions \"orange feet,\" which is not present in the ground truth attributes (the ground truth states `has_leg_color::black`). This is an incorrect or hallucinated attribute and thus counts as a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives (27):** The ground truth contains 28 attributes in total. The caption only mentions one of them (\"black\") and introduces one incorrect attribute (\"orange feet\"). As a result, 27 attributes from the ground truth are not mentioned in the caption and are considered false negatives. These include details about the bird's size, shape, bill, wing colors, patterns, and other physical features.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 28\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives (1):** The caption mentions that the bird is \"black and red,\" which partially captures the presence of red and black in the bird's appearance (specifically the wing colors). This is a correct mention, though not fully detailed.\n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption mentions an \"orange underbelly,\" which is not present in the ground truth attributes. The underparts, belly, and under_tail are all described as black in the ground truth, so this is an incorrect addition.\n\n- **False Negatives (28):** The majority of the bird's attributes in the ground truth are not mentioned in the caption. These include the bird's small size, perching-like shape, all-purpose bill shape, black bill, black eyes, black legs, black crown, black forehead, black nape, black throat, black breast, black belly, black under_tail, black back, black upper_tail, black upperparts, black underparts, solid patterns on the breast, back, belly, tail, and the notched tail shape. All of these are present in the ground truth but absent in the caption.\n\nIn summary, the caption only captures a small part of the bird's appearance and introduces an incorrect detail. It lacks most of the specific attributes that define the bird in the ground truth.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 28\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption describes the bird as \"black\" and mentions \"red breast and wings,\" but the ground truth attributes do not include a red breast or red wings. Instead, the bird has multiple wing colors including yellow, black, and red, but the red is likely part of the multi-colored wing pattern, not specifically on the breast. The caption incorrectly introduces the red color on the breast, which is a **false positive**. The bird in the ground truth is entirely black in most body parts and has a small size and perching-like shape, but these are not mentioned in the caption, leading to **false negatives**. Additionally, the caption mentions the bird is \"perked up in a sunny field,\" which is not an attribute of the bird itself, so it does not count toward true or false positives/negatives.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 28\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe generated caption \"A bird with a red spot on its chest\" does not accurately capture any of the ground truth attributes. The only color mentioned in the caption is \"red,\" which could loosely relate to the presence of \"has_wing_color::red\" in the ground truth. However, the caption incorrectly places the red color on the \"chest\" (which is typically part of the \"underparts\" or \"breast\"), and the ground truth specifies that the \"breast_color\" and \"underparts_color\" are black. Therefore, the red spot is both misplaced and inconsistent with the actual description.\n\nAdditionally, the caption omits all other attributes such as the bird's small size, black coloration across most body parts, solid patterns, black eye and bill, and the notched tail shape. Since the caption does not include any correct attributes, there are no true positives. There are also no false positives because the caption does not mention any attributes that contradict the ground truth. All 28 attributes in the ground truth are not mentioned, resulting in 28 false negatives."

These are considered true positives.\n\n- **False Positives (None):** The caption does not mention any attributes that are not present in the ground truth. Therefore, there are no false positives.\n\n- **False Negatives (30):** The caption is very brief and only describes the general coloration of the bird. It omits a large number of specific attributes such as **bill shape**, **wing shape**, **tail shape**, **eye color**, **bill length**, **leg color**, **breast pattern**, **tail pattern**, and many others that are detailed in the ground truth.

For example, it mentions \"yellow and gray,\" which are present in the ground truth, but it does not correctly describe the specific body parts or patterns where these colors occur.\n\n- **False Positives: 1**  \n  The caption mentions \"brown spots on its chest,\" which is not part of the ground truth. The bird's breast is described as \"multi-colored,\" and the breast color includes grey and yellow, but there is no mention of brown spots. This is a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives: 31**  \n  The ground truth contains 31 attributes (e.g., bill shape, wing color, tail shape, eye color, etc.), and the caption does not mention any of them accurately. It completely misses the description of the bird's bill, wing shape, tail pattern, and other distinctive features that are present in the ground truth.",

These include specific details such as bill shape, wing color, tail shape, head pattern, bill length, leg color, and others. The caption is very general and lacks the specific visual and structural details provided in the ground truth. It only captures the basic size and color scheme of the bird.",

However, it fails to mention any of the other detailed attributes such as bill shape, wing color, tail shape, eye color, leg color, or size, which are all part of the ground truth.

It only mentions the bird's location or action. None of the 30 ground truth attributes related to the bird's appearance (e.g., color, shape, pattern, size) are mentioned in the caption.
