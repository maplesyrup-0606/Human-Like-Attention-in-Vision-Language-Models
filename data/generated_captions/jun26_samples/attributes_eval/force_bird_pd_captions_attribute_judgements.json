However, it completely omits all other 20 attributes, such as color details (e.g., black wings, grey breast), bill shape and length, eye color, and other physical features.

It only provides a general scenario of a bird being perched and having its beak open. None of the 21 ground truth attributes (such as bill shape, wing color, underparts color, etc.) are mentioned in the caption. As a result, there are no true positives (correctly mentioned attributes) or false positives (attributes mentioned that are not in the ground truth).

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 48\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption describes the bird as \"small\" and \"brown,\" which could loosely align with the ground truth attributes (`has_size::very_small_(3_-_5_in)` and `has_primary_color::brown`). However, the caption does not explicitly mention \"very small\" or provide any other accurate details about the bird's features. Instead, it introduces the term \"beige,\" which is not present in the ground truth, making it a **false positive**. Additionally, it mentions a \"spotted and speckled breast,\" which is not accurate \u2014 the ground truth specifies a \"striped\" breast, not spotted or speckled.

These are the only two attributes from the ground truth that are explicitly captured in the caption.\n\nHowever, the caption is very minimal and lacks detailed descriptions of the bird's physical features. It does not mention any of the other attributes such as wing color, breast pattern, tail shape, bill shape, or leg color, which are all part of the ground truth.

The bird is described as having a \"brown and yellow body,\" but the ground truth does not include yellow as a color attribute for any part of the bird. Additionally, the bird's size is described as \"small,\" which is somewhat close to \"very_small_(3_-_5_in)\" in the ground truth, but this is not explicitly mentioned or captured in a way that can be considered a true positive.\n\n- **False Positives: 1** \u2014 The mention of \"yellow\" in the caption is a false positive because \"yellow\" is not part of any of the bird's attributes in the ground truth. The bird's colors include brown, black, grey, orange, white, and buff, but not yellow.\n\n- **False Negatives: None** \u2014 This is because we are counting specific attributes from the ground truth, and the caption does not mention any of them. Since the caption is very brief and generic, it does not provide enough detail to claim any of the ground truth attributes were missed. If we were to count the number of missed attributes, it would be very high, but since the task is to count the number of attributes in the ground truth that were not mentioned, and the caption mentions none, the count is \"None.\"",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: All\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe generated caption (\"A bird is perched on a branch in a leafy green forest, possibly a warbler, with its beak tucked under its wing.\") provides a general scene description but **does not mention any of the specific attributes** listed in the ground truth. The attributes include detailed features such as bill shape, wing color, breast pattern, tail shape, and more \u2014 all of which are **not described or implied** in the caption.\n\n- **True Positives = 0**: None of the attributes are correctly mentioned.\n- **False Positives = 0**: The caption does not make any claims that contradict or go beyond the ground truth attributes.\n- **False Negatives = All**: All the ground truth attributes are not captured in the caption.\n\nThis result suggests that the caption lacks specificity and does not reflect the detailed visual characteristics of the bird provided in the ground truth."

The caption mentions \"blue wing,\" but the ground truth includes multiple colors for the wings (brown, yellow, green), and blue is not listed as a wing color. Similarly, \"green feathers on the tip\" is not supported by the ground truth, which does not specify green on the wing tip.\n\n- **False Positives:** The caption mentions \"blue wing,\" which is not a valid attribute in the ground truth for the wings (blue is mentioned for other body parts like the crown, nape, etc.). It also mentions \"green feathers on the tip,\" which is not an attribute in the ground truth at all. Therefore, there is **1 false positive** (green feathers on the tip).\n\n- **False Negatives:** The caption is very brief and omits nearly all of the ground truth attributes, including multiple colors for the upperparts, underparts, breast, throat, bill, and more. Since the ground truth contains **34 attributes** and the caption mentions **none** of them correctly, all 34 are considered **false negatives**.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides incorrect or unsupported information and misses almost all of the relevant attributes from the ground truth.",

Therefore, these four colors count as **True Positives**.\n\nThere are **no False Positives**, as the caption does not mention any attributes (e.g., bill shape, tail shape, eye color, etc.) that are not present in the ground truth.\n\nHowever, the caption is **very limited in the information it conveys**. It omits a large number of attributes such as **bill shape**, **wing shape**, **eye color**, **bill color**, **tail shape**, **breast pattern**, **head pattern**, **size**, **shape**, **leg color**, and many more.

It does not mention the bird's red coloration (which is present in multiple body parts), the multi-colored breast, the wing shape and color, the pointed tail, the eyering head pattern, the eye color, bill characteristics, leg color, or any of the other detailed attributes. These omissions are considered false negatives because the attributes are present in the ground truth but not reflected in the caption.\n\nOverall, the caption provides a very high-level and inaccurate description, missing most of the key features that define the bird.",

It only mentions the bird's general action (perching) and a vague emotional state (in a hurry). None of the 35 ground truth attributes (e.g., colors, patterns, bill shape, wing shape, etc.) are mentioned in the caption. Since no attributes are explicitly stated, there are no true positives or false positives. All 35 attributes from the ground truth are missed, resulting in 35 false negatives."

The ground truth includes multiple specific attributes such as bill shape, wing color, breast pattern, tail shape, and many others, none of which are mentioned in the caption. \n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption mentions a \"black head,\" which is not present in the ground truth (the head pattern is \"malar,\" and the forehead and crown are \"buff\").\n- **False Negatives (30):** All 30 ground truth attributes are not captured or reflected in the caption, which is very brief and omits all the specific features.\n- **True Positives (0):** No attributes from the ground truth are accurately described in the caption.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 2\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 30\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption correctly mentions that the bird is \"small\" (which aligns with the `has_size::small_(5_-_9_in)` attribute) and that it has \"brown and white feathers\" (which aligns with several color-related attributes such as `has_wing_color::white`, `has_underparts_color::white`, `has_breast_color::white`, `has_throat_color::white`, `has_belly_color::white`, `has_primary_color::white`, and the brown color in `has_nape_color::brown`). Thus, these count as true positives.\n\nHowever, the caption is very general and fails to capture most of the detailed attributes, such as bill shape, wing shape, head pattern, eye color, bill color, etc. Since it does not mention any attributes that are not present in the ground truth, there are no false positives. The large number of false negatives reflects the many specific attributes that were not mentioned in the caption.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 2\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 29\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives (2):**  \n  The caption mentions \"brown and white bird,\" which aligns with some of the ground truth attributes such as `has_wing_color::white`, `has_underparts_color::white`, `has_breast_color::white`, `has_throat_color::white`, `has_belly_color::white`, and `has_primary_color::white`. While the caption does not explicitly mention \"buff,\" \"white\" is a valid color in the ground truth. The mention of \"bird\" is also accurate.\n\n- **False Positives (1):**  \n  The caption mentions \"a tuft of feathers on its head,\" which is not present in the ground truth attributes. The attribute `has_head_pattern::malar` refers to a specific facial pattern (a stripe from the eye to the neck), not a tuft of feathers. Therefore, this is a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives (29):**  \n  The caption omits the majority of the bird's defining attributes, such as its bill shape, wing shape, size, breast pattern, tail shape, eye color, bill color, and many others. These are all part of the ground truth but are not captured in the caption. The caption is very general and lacks the detailed description provided in the ground truth.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 29\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe provided caption, \"A bird, with its foot on a piece of wood, sits next to a body of water,\" does not mention any of the specific attributes related to the bird's physical characteristics (e.g., bill shape, wing color, breast pattern, etc.). All 29 attributes listed in the ground truth are related to the bird's appearance and are not reflected in the caption. Therefore, there are no true positives (correctly mentioned attributes) and no false positives (attributes mentioned that are not in the ground truth). All 29 attributes from the ground truth are considered false negatives because they were not addressed in the caption."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 3\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 31\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives (3):**\n  - \"black\" is mentioned and is consistent with multiple ground truth attributes (e.g., `has_wing_color::black`, `has_upperparts_color::black`, etc.).\n  - \"curved beak\" correctly captures the `has_bill_shape::hooked_seabird` attribute.\n  - \"black patch on the forehead\" corresponds to the `has_forehead_color::black` attribute.\n\n- **False Positives (1):**\n  - \"yellow\" is mentioned in the caption, but the only yellow reference in the ground truth is `has_nape_color::yellow`. However, the caption does not specifically mention the nape area, so this is considered a false positive as the yellow is implied to be elsewhere on the bird.\n\n- **False Negatives (31):**\n  - The caption fails to mention the vast majority of the bird's attributes, including multiple color attributes (e.g., white in various body parts), specific patterns (e.g., solid breast, multi-colored belly), size, shape, wing shape, bill length, etc.\n  - The caption is very brief and does not reflect the detailed visual description provided in the ground truth attributes.\n\nIn summary, while the caption does capture a few key features, it lacks the detailed and accurate description that would be expected given the rich set of ground truth attributes.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 33\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives:** There are no attributes correctly mentioned in the caption. The caption does not accurately describe any of the bird's attributes listed in the ground truth.\n\n- **False Positives:** The caption mentions \"yellowish beak,\" which is not present in the ground truth. The bird's bill color is specified as black, and there is no mention of yellow in the bill or beak area.\n\n- **False Negatives:** The caption omits nearly all of the bird's defining characteristics, such as its hooked seabird bill shape, black and white coloration patterns, solid breast pattern, tapered wings, and other specific features. Therefore, all 33 attributes from the ground truth are not mentioned in the caption.\n\nThe caption is not aligned with the ground truth attributes and provides minimal, inaccurate information about the bird.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 2\nFalse Negatives: 34\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives:** There are no attributes in the ground truth that are correctly mentioned in the caption. The caption refers to a \"yellow breast\" and \"gray feathers,\" neither of which are present in the ground truth attributes. The breast is described as \"white\" in the ground truth, and there is no mention of gray feathers at all.\n\n- **False Positives:** The caption mentions two attributes (\"yellow breast\" and \"gray feathers\") that are not present in the ground truth. These are considered false positives because they are incorrectly introduced in the caption.\n\n- **False Negatives:** The caption omits all 34 ground truth attributes, including key features like black and white coloration, hooked bill, pointed tail, solid patterns, and more. Since these are all present in the ground truth but not mentioned in the caption, they are false negatives.\n\nIn summary, the caption does not accurately reflect the ground truth attributes and introduces incorrect details, leading to a poor match.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 3\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 30\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives:**\n  - \"black and white bird\" correctly captures two of the primary colors (`has_primary_color::black`, `has_primary_color::white`).\n  - \"yellow chest\" correctly refers to the `has_nape_color::yellow` attribute (though it's imprecise, as the yellow is on the nape, not the chest; however, it's a close enough approximation to be considered a true positive).\n\n- **False Positives:**\n  - \"large bird\" is mentioned in the caption, but the ground truth specifies the bird is of `has_size::medium_(9_-_16_in)`. Therefore, \"large\" is incorrect and counts as a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives:**\n  - The caption omits the vast majority of the ground truth attributes. These include bill shape, wing shape, tail shape, color patterns, eye color, bill color, leg color, and many other specific visual features. Since the caption is very brief and general, it fails to mention most of the detailed attributes provided in the ground truth.\n\nOverall, the caption is highly inaccurate in capturing the detailed bird attributes provided in the ground truth. It only partially captures a few color-related attributes and incorrectly describes the bird's size."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 42\n```\n\n**Reason for the results:**\n\n- **True Positives (1):** The caption correctly mentions that the bird has a \"blue body,\" which aligns with several ground truth attributes such as `has_upperparts_color::blue`, `has_underparts_color::blue`, `has_breast_color::blue`, `has_forehead_color::blue`, `has_nape_color::blue`, and `has_belly_color::blue`. So, this is a valid true positive.\n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption mentions a \"white tail,\" but there is no mention of white in the ground truth attributes for the tail. The tail is described as having colors blue and black (`has_upper_tail_color::blue`, `has_upper_tail_color::black`, `has_under_tail_color::blue`, `has_under_tail_color::black`). Therefore, \"white tail\" is a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives (42):** The caption fails to mention the vast majority of the bird's attributes. These include its bill shape, wing color, upperparts color, breast pattern, tail shape, eye color, bill length, bill color, leg color, and many others. Since these are all part of the ground truth but not mentioned in the caption, they are all considered false negatives.\n\nOverall, the caption is very minimal and does not accurately reflect the detailed appearance of the bird as described by the ground truth attributes.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 3\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 42\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives (3):**\n  - The caption correctly mentions **\"blue\"**, which is a dominant color in the bird's **wing**, **upperparts**, **underparts**, **back**, **tail**, **forehead**, **nape**, **belly**, **throat**, and **breast**.\n  - The caption correctly mentions **\"orange\"**, which is a **wing color** in the ground truth.\n  - The caption correctly mentions **\"black\"**, which is a color present in the **wing**, **upperparts**, **underparts**, **tail**, **back**, and **leg**.\n\n- **False Positives (0):**\n  - The caption does not mention any attributes that are not present in the ground truth. All the colors and features mentioned in the caption are part of the ground truth.\n\n- **False Negatives (42):**\n  - The caption is very brief and omits a large number of specific attributes from the ground truth, including:\n    - Bill shape (`cone`), bill length (`shorter_than_head`), bill color (`grey`)\n    - Wing shape (`long-wings`)\n    - Tail shape (`notched_tail`)\n    - Head pattern (`eyering`)\n    - Breast pattern (`solid`)\n    - Belly pattern (`solid`)\n    - Back pattern (`multi-colored`)\n    - Tail pattern (`multi-colored`)\n    - Size (`small_(5_-_9_in)`)\n    - Shape (`perching-like`)\n    - Primary colors (`blue`, `black`, `buff`)\n    - Many other color and pattern attributes that are not captured in the caption.\n\n**Conclusion:** The caption captures only a small fraction of the detailed attributes in the ground truth, making it a very incomplete description.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 47\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives (1):** The caption correctly mentions that the bird has a **blue body**, which aligns with the ground truth attribute `has_upperparts_color::blue` and `has_breast_color::blue`.\n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption mentions an **orange chest**, but there is **no mention of orange in the ground truth attributes**. The chest (breast) is described as blue (`has_breast_color::blue`), so \"orange chest\" is not accurate and is therefore a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives (47):** The caption is very brief and **misses a large number of attributes** from the ground truth. These include:\n  - Multiple color attributes (e.g., black, buff, grey)\n  - Bill shape and length\n  - Wing shape and color\n  - Tail shape and color\n  - Head and eye patterns\n  - Size and shape\n  - Leg and bill color\n  - Throat, belly, nape, and forehead color\n\nThe caption only provides a very high-level and incomplete description, missing most of the detailed attributes provided in the ground truth.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 47\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption mentions \"blue\" (which corresponds to several blue color attributes in the ground truth, such as wing, upperparts, underparts, etc.), and \"perched on a tree limb,\" which implies the bird is perching, matching the `has_shape::perching-like` attribute. However, it also mentions \"white,\" which is not present in the ground truth attributes, making it a false positive. The caption fails to capture the vast majority of the bird's attributes, including its bill shape, wing shape, multiple color combinations, patterns, eye color, bill length, and size. Therefore, most attributes are false negatives."

The ground truth includes a variety of attributes such as color (e.g., black, buff, grey), patterns (e.g., multi-colored, solid), body parts (e.g., breast, underparts, wings), and physical features (e.g., short bill, fan-shaped tail). However, the caption fails to mention any of these, making them **False Negatives**. There are no **True Positives** because none of the attributes in the caption match the ground truth.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 3\nFalse Negatives: 29\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives:** There are no true positives because none of the attributes mentioned in the caption match the ground truth attributes. The ground truth includes colors like black, grey, and buff, but does not include yellow, red, or white as described in the caption.\n\n- **False Positives:** The caption mentions three attributes that are not present in the ground truth:\n  - \"yellow\" (not in ground truth)\n  - \"red chest\" (not in ground truth)\n  - \"white wings\" (not in ground truth)\n\n- **False Negatives:** The caption fails to mention any of the 29 ground truth attributes. These include colors (e.g., black, buff, grey), patterns (e.g., multi-colored, solid), body parts (e.g., fan-shaped tail, pointed wings), and other features (e.g., short bill, small size). The caption is entirely mismatched with the actual attributes of the bird.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 29\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives: 0**  \n  The caption does not correctly mention any of the ground truth attributes. The bird is described as having an \"orange chest,\" but the ground truth attributes specify that the breast color is \"grey\" and \"black,\" and there is no mention of orange in the attributes.\n\n- **False Positives: 1**  \n  The caption mentions an \"orange chest,\" which is not present in the ground truth attributes. This is a false positive because the attribute is mentioned in the caption but does not match the actual bird description.\n\n- **False Negatives: 29**  \n  The ground truth contains 29 attributes (e.g., black wing color, fan-shaped tail, multi-colored breast pattern, etc.), but the caption does not mention any of them.
