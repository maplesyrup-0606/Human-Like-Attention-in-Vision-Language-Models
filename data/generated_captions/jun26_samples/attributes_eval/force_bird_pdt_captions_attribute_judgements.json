    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 34\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption mentions that the bird is \"black,\" which aligns with the ground truth that includes multiple \"black\" color attributes (e.g., `has_bill_color::black`, `has_eye_color::black`, `has_leg_color::black`, etc.). This counts as **1 True Positive**.\n\nThe caption also mentions an \"orange beak,\" which is **not** present in the ground truth (the bill is described as black). This is a **False Positive**.\n\nThe ground truth contains **34 attributes**, many of which are detailed descriptions of color, shape, and pattern across different parts of the bird (e.g., wings, tail, breast, etc.). The caption only mentions the bird being black and having an orange beak, missing all other attributes. Therefore, there are **34 False Negatives**.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 2\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 33\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives**: The caption correctly mentions two attributes from the ground truth:\n  - `has_wing_color::black`\n  - `has_upperparts_color::red` (implied by \"black and red bird\")\n\n- **False Positives**: The caption mentions one attribute that is not in the ground truth:\n  - `orange beak` \u2014 the ground truth specifies that the bill color is black (`has_bill_color::black`), not orange.\n\n- **False Negatives**: There are 33 attributes in the ground truth that are not mentioned in the caption. These include:\n  - Bill shape (`dagger`)\n  - Wing shape (`rounded-wings`)\n  - Tail shape (`pointed_tail`)\n  - Size (`small_(5_-_9_in)`)\n  - Shape (`perching-like`)\n  - Multiple color attributes for various body parts (e.g., `buff` colors, `solid` patterns)\n  - Eye color, leg color, etc.\n\nThe caption is very brief and only captures a few of the many attributes described in the ground truth. It does not mention most of the detailed physical features, and it incorrectly describes the beak color.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 34\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe generated caption mentions **\"A bird with a red breast\"**, which is **not present in the ground truth attributes**. The ground truth specifies that the bird has a **black breast** (`has_breast_color::black`), so this is a **False Positive**.\n\nThe caption also mentions **\"stands on a twig, perched and ready to fly\"**, which are **not attributes** and thus not relevant for this evaluation.\n\nThe caption **does not mention any of the 34 ground truth attributes**, including the bird's **black bill**, **black wings**, **black breast**, **small size**, **dagger-shaped bill**, **rounded wings**, or **pointed tail**, among others.

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 2\nFalse Negatives: 34\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives:** There are no attributes from the ground truth that are correctly mentioned in the caption. While the caption says \"black bird,\" this is not sufficient to count as a true positive for the many \"black\" attributes in the ground truth, as they refer to specific parts (e.g., bill, wing, back, etc.) that are not mentioned. Similarly, \"brown wings\" is incorrect (the ground truth includes \"buff\" and \"red\" but not \"brown\"), and \"orange beak\" is not in the ground truth (the bill is black and dagger-shaped).\n\n- **False Positives:** The caption includes two attributes that are not in the ground truth:\n  - \"orange beak\" (the bill is black).\n  - \"brown wings\" (the wings are described as having colors black, red, and buff, but not brown).\n\n- **False Negatives:** The caption fails to mention all 34 attributes from the ground truth. These include the bird's small size, black bill, dagger-shaped bill, rounded wings, black wing color, black upperparts, solid patterns, and many other specific color and shape attributes. None of these are captured in the caption, which is very brief and inaccurate in comparison to the detailed ground truth."

This is a mismatch and thus a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives (26):**\n  - The caption is very brief and does not capture most of the detailed attributes in the ground truth. For example, it does not mention the bill shape (`dagger`), wing shape (`broad-wings`), bill length, head pattern, breast pattern, eye color, or many color-related attributes. As a result, 26 attributes are missing from the caption.\n\nIn summary, the caption provides a very high-level description and misses the majority of the detailed attributes, leading to a large number of false negatives and one false positive.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: None\nFalse Negatives: 24\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe caption \"A red and white bird is perched on a tree branch\" correctly captures the presence of **rufous (red)** and **white** colors, which aligns with the ground truth attributes such as `has_primary_color::rufous`, `has_underparts_color::white`, `has_breast_color::rufous`, `has_throat_color::rufous`, `has_forehead_color::rufous`, `has_nape_color::rufous`, and `has_belly_color::white`. This counts as **1 true positive** since it captures the presence of these color attributes, albeit in a simplified and generalized way.\n\nHowever, the caption omits **24 attributes**, including specific details like bill shape, wing color, wing shape, eye color, bill length, head pattern, breast pattern, belly pattern, and others. These are all **false negatives** because the caption does not mention them.\n\nThere are **no false positives** because the caption does not mention any attributes that are not supported by the ground truth.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 26\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption mentions that the bird has a \"red head,\" which corresponds to the ground truth attribute `has_forehead_color::rufous` and `has_crown_color::rufous` (rufous is a reddish color). Additionally, the \"white body\" aligns with several white color attributes in the ground truth, such as `has_underparts_color::white`, `has_belly_color::white`, and possibly `has_upperparts_color::white`. However, this is a very general description and does not specify the exact pattern or other distinguishing features. \n\nThe caption fails to capture most of the other attributes, such as bill shape, wing color, breast pattern, and others. It does not mention any of the multi-colored aspects, the dagger-shaped bill, the pigeon-like shape, or the size. Therefore, the majority of the attributes are missed, resulting in a high number of false negatives. There are no false positives since the caption does not mention any attributes not present in the ground truth.",

This is a correct mention of an attribute present in the ground truth.\n\n- **False Positives (0):** The caption does not mention any attributes that are not in the ground truth. While \"red-headed\" refers only to the forehead, it does not include any incorrect attributes.\n\n- **False Negatives (23):** The caption is very brief and fails to mention the vast majority of the ground truth attributes. These include details about the bill shape, wing color, upperparts color, underparts color, breast pattern and color, throat color, eye color, bill length, nape color, belly color and pattern, size, shape, and wing pattern. All of these are present in the ground truth but not captured in the caption.\n\nOverall, the caption is incomplete and captures only a small fraction of the detailed attributes provided in the ground truth."

While it mentions the bird is \"small\" (which aligns with the `has_size::small_(5_-_9_in)` attribute), it does not explicitly state \"small\" in a way that can be directly mapped to the formal attribute. The caption is too vague and lacks the specificity needed to confirm any true positive matches.\n\n- **False Positives: 1**  \n  The caption mentions the bird is \"gray-striped,\" which implies a gray color and a striped pattern. However, the ground truth does not include any striped pattern attributes (e.g., `has_wing_pattern::striped` is present, but it is not described as \"striped\" in the caption in a way that can be verified). The mention of \"gray\" could be considered a partial match to the multiple `has_*_color::grey` attributes, but the \"striped\" part is not supported by the ground truth, making this a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives: None**  \n  The caption does not mention enough attributes to have any false negatives, but technically, it could be said that the caption fails to capture the vast majority of the attributes. However, since the prompt asks to list the number of attributes in the ground truth but not mentioned, and the caption does not mention any, we cannot assign a specific count, hence `None`.",
    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: None\nFalse Negatives: 34\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe caption \"A small bird is perched on a branch\" contains only one attribute that matches the ground truth: **'has_size::small_(5_-_9_in)'**, which is captured by the word \"small\". \n\nHowever, the caption completely omits all other attributes, including colors (e.g., blue, grey, buff), patterns (e.g., multi-colored, solid), shapes (e.g., fan-shaped tail, pointed wings), and other specific features (e.g., eyebrow head pattern, short bill, gull-like shape).

All of the ground truth attributes describe detailed visual features (e.g., colors of various body parts, bill shape, wing shape, etc.) that are completely absent from the caption.

While the ground truth has multiple yellow attributes, the mention of \"yellow\" in the caption is sufficient to count as a true positive.\n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption mentions \"black on its face,\" which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth. The bird has black wings, but there is no attribute indicating black on the face. This is a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives (48):** The ground truth includes a large number of attributes (e.g., bill shape, wing color, underparts color, breast pattern, tail shape, etc.) that are not mentioned in the caption at all. The caption is very brief and does not capture most of the detailed visual characteristics of the bird. For example, it does not mention the white, olive, or grey colors; the notched tail; the solid breast pattern; the short bill; or the multi-colored patterns on the tail, back, and belly.\n\nIn summary, the caption is very limited in the information it provides and fails to capture the vast majority of the bird's attributes, making it a poor match to the ground truth.",

Therefore, there are no true positives.\n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption mentions \"yellow beak,\" but the ground truth states the bill color is \"orange.\" Since the caption includes an attribute (beak color) that is not consistent with the ground truth, this counts as a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives (27):** There are 28 attributes in the ground truth, and the caption fails to mention any of them except for the incorrect beak color. Therefore, all 27 remaining attributes are false negatives.
