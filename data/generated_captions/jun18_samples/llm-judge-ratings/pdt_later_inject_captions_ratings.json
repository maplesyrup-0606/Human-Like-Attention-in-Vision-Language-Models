    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions traffic lights and a street light, which are relevant to the ground truth captions. However, it does not capture the key elements present in the ground truth, such as the stormy sky, the traffic camera, the sign that reads \"K,\" or the context of an intersection. The generated caption is somewhat generic and lacks the detailed description of the overall scene. It is moderately relevant but misses several important details.\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the main subject (a train) and its motion (travels down a set of tracks), which aligns with several ground truth captions. It also mentions \"other tracks above it,\" which is a reasonable interpretation of an elevated subway or a train going over a bridge with additional tracks. However, it lacks specific details such as the city setting, the train turning direction, or the sunny day, which are present in the ground truths. The caption is mostly relevant and includes key elements, but it omits some important contextual and descriptive details.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes a train \"pulling into a metal station\" and \"going under a bridge.\" While the general subject (a train) is present and consistent with the ground truth captions, the details differ significantly. The ground truth captions emphasize the train going through a city, turning on tracks, and going over a bridge, while the generated caption incorrectly states the train is going under a bridge and mentions a metal station, which is not referenced in any of the ground truths. The caption is somewhat relevant but lacks alignment with the key details in the ground truths, especially the bridge and city context. It captures a partial idea but misses important relationships and specific elements.  \nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the key idea of a train traveling over a bridge, which aligns with one of the ground truth captions (\"A train that is going over a bridge overlooking the city\"). It also adds additional details such as \"passing under another bridge and through a tunnel,\" which are not explicitly mentioned in the ground truths but are not contradictory. However, the generated caption does not fully reflect the broader context of the city or the elevated subway setting mentioned in several ground truths. It is mostly relevant and includes specific details but misses some important contextual elements present in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A train on a train track\" is minimally relevant to the ground truth captions, as it correctly identifies the presence of a train and train tracks, which are mentioned in several ground truths. However, it lacks any specific details such as the setting (city, bridge, elevated subway), the action (turning, going through, riding along), or the additional context (sunny day, different direction). The caption is overly generic and does not capture the richness or specific elements described in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 2"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A cat in a blue tube on a desk\" is somewhat relevant to the ground truth captions, as it mentions a cat and a blue object (tube), which is similar to the \"blue bowl\" and \"blue hat\" mentioned in the ground truths. However, the \"blue tube\" is not an exact match for any of the described objects (bowl, bucket, hat), and the context of the cat's action (in, climbing out of, jumping out of) is not captured. The generated caption is vague and lacks specific details that are present in the ground truths. It only partially aligns with the general idea of a cat interacting with a blue object on a surface. \n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A cat plays in a blue plastic object\" is moderately relevant to the ground truth captions. It correctly identifies the presence of a cat and a blue plastic object, which aligns with several ground truth captions that describe a cat interacting with a blue bowl or bucket. However, the caption is somewhat generic and lacks specific details such as the cat's actions (e.g., climbing, tumbling, jumping), the exact object (bowl vs. bucket), and additional context like the table or food scale mentioned in the ground truths. While it captures the general idea, it misses finer details and specific relationships described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes a gray cat playing on a blue disc toy on a wood table. While it does involve a cat and a blue object on a table, it misses most of the key elements present in the ground truth captions. The ground truths describe a cat interacting with a bowl (tumbling, jumping, climbing), a plastic bucket, and a blue hat on a table. The generated caption introduces a blue disc toy instead of a bowl or bucket and does not capture the specific actions (jumping, climbing, tumbling) or the presence of a food scale and pen/paper. It is somewhat relevant in that it involves a cat and a blue object on a table, but it lacks the specificity and alignment with the actual content described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a cat and a blue item (blue and white ball), which is somewhat related to the blue bowl and blue hat mentioned in the ground truth captions. However, the key elements such as the cat being in or climbing out of a blue bowl, or standing in a blue hat on a table are not captured. The generated caption introduces a new object (a blue and white ball) not present in the ground truth and fails to convey the main actions (climbing, jumping, sitting, or tumbling) described in the ground truth. The location \"on a desk\" is also not aligned with the table or bowl context in the ground truths. The caption is somewhat relevant but lacks significant detail and alignment with the core content of the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 2"
