    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes a \"large brown wooden counter with a sink and a faucet,\" which is a specific and accurate description that aligns with several of the ground truth captions. It captures key elements such as the counter, sink, and the general kitchen setting implied by these objects. However, it does not mention other important elements present in the ground truths, such as the table and chairs, cabinets, or the kitchen island/peninsula. While the description is detailed and relevant, it is not fully aligned with the broader context and additional details provided in the ground truth captions. Therefore, it is mostly relevant and detailed but misses some key components.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a kitchen and a silver faucet on an island, which is a relevant detail found in some of the ground truth captions (e.g., \"A kitchen island has a farmhouse sink on it.\" and \"A sink in a peninsula in a kitchen.\"). However, it is quite minimal and omits many key elements present in the ground truth descriptions, such as the table and chairs, wooden cabinets, marble countertop, and the overall layout of the kitchen. While it captures a part of the scene, it lacks completeness and richness in describing the overall setting.  \nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a \"white toilet\" and a \"bucket on the floor,\" both of which are present in the ground truth captions. However, it lacks specific details such as the color of the bucket (red or orange), the presence of a stool, the tiled nature of the bathroom, and the context of plumbing drips. The caption is moderately relevant but omits several key elements and relationships described in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A bucket on a chair next to a toilet\" captures the general idea present in several ground truth captions. It correctly identifies the presence of a bucket, a chair (or stool), and a toilet, which are key elements mentioned in multiple ground truths. However, it lacks specific details such as the color of the bucket (red or orange), the tiled nature of the bathroom, the open shower, and the mention of plumbing drips. While it is mostly relevant and includes the main objects and their spatial relationships, it omits some important contextual and descriptive details that appear in the ground truths. Therefore, it falls just short of a perfect match.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a bathroom and a white toilet, which are relevant to the ground truth captions. However, it omits most of the key elements described in the ground truths, such as the presence of a shower, the bucket(s) on a stool, and the mention of plumbing drips. The caption is somewhat relevant but lacks detail and misses most of the important components that are central to the ground truth descriptions. It only captures a partial and simplified version of the scene.\nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption accurately describes a red bucket on a stool next to a toilet in a bathroom, which is consistent with several ground truth captions. It captures key elements such as the color (red), the object (bucket), its placement (on a stool, next to a toilet), and the location (bathroom). While it does not explicitly mention the tiled nature of the bathroom or the open shower, these are not central to most of the ground truths. The caption is specific and aligns well with the overall meaning conveyed by the ground truths. It includes relevant attributes and relationships and is only slightly lacking in capturing all contextual elements.  \nTotal rating: 4"
