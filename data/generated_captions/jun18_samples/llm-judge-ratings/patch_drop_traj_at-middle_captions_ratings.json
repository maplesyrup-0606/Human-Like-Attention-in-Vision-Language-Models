    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the main action (a woman slicing a cake) and includes a relevant detail (someone watching). However, it introduces an element not present in the ground truth captions (a man in a red shirt), which may not align with the actual image. Additionally, the mention of \"berries on top\" is not reflected in any of the ground truths, suggesting a deviation from the key elements described. While the general idea is present, the caption lacks some accuracy and misses finer contextual details, such as the presence of a group or table, or the ambiguity of the observers (e.g., \"a girl slicing a pie inside a box\"). Therefore, it is mostly relevant but not fully aligned.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions \"women cutting a cake on top of a table,\" which aligns with several ground truth captions that describe a similar scene. It also adds specific details like \"one holds a knife the other holds a fork,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truths but is plausible. However, the caption omits the key detail of *others watching*, which is central to multiple ground truth captions. While the caption is relevant and includes some specific elements, it misses a core aspect of the scene (the observers), making it mostly but not fully aligned with the overall meaning of the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes a man cutting a cake and a woman holding a piece on a table with multiple cakes and plates. This is somewhat relevant to the ground truth captions, which describe a woman cutting a cake and others watching. However, the generated caption introduces a man instead of a woman as the one cutting the cake, which is a significant deviation from the ground truth. It also adds a woman holding a piece and multiple cakes and plates, which are not mentioned in the ground truth. While the general scene of cake-cutting and people involved is captured, the key detail of the woman cutting the cake is incorrect, and the additional elements are not supported by the ground truth. The caption is moderately relevant but lacks precision and includes inaccuracies.\n\nTotal rating: 3",

Additionally, the generated caption omits other key elements like the presence of a group of people, the table, or the specific context of celebration or gathering. While the core action is captured, the inclusion of an irrelevant and potentially offensive detail and the omission of other important contextual elements reduces its overall alignment and accuracy.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions \"a kitchen,\" which is the central subject of the ground truth captions. It correctly identifies the presence of \"wood cabinets,\" which is a key element in multiple ground truth captions. Additionally, it adds details about \"white counters\" and \"white appliances,\" which, while not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth, are reasonable inferences and do not contradict the provided descriptions. However, the generated caption lacks some of the broader descriptions present in the ground truth, such as the kitchen being medium or small-sized, being filled with various appliances, or being clean. It is mostly relevant and includes several key details, but it omits some important contextual and descriptive elements.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption is mostly relevant and includes several key elements found in the ground truth captions. It accurately describes the presence of a refrigerator, oven, microwave, and cabinets, which are all mentioned in multiple ground truth captions. However, it does not mention the overall size of the kitchen (medium or small), nor does it fully capture the idea that the kitchen is clean or filled with various appliances. The generated caption is detailed but misses some context and broader descriptors present in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a \"small kitchen\" which aligns with at least two of the ground truth captions that mention a small or medium-sized kitchen. It also includes the presence of a refrigerator and an oven, which are common appliances mentioned in the ground truths. However, the caption lacks detail about the wood cabinets, which are a key element in multiple ground truth captions. Additionally, the color details (e.g., \"white kitchen,\" \"black oven,\" \"black and white refrigerator\") are not emphasized in the ground truths, making them potentially irrelevant or distracting. The caption captures the general idea of a small kitchen with appliances but misses key elements like cabinets and does not fully align with the richness of the ground truth descriptions.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the general idea of a kitchen with appliances, which is consistent with the ground truth captions. It specifically mentions a refrigerator and a stove, both of which are present in multiple ground truth captions. However, it omits details such as the wood cabinets or the size of the kitchen (medium or small), which are mentioned in several of the ground truths. The caption is mostly relevant and includes key elements, but it lacks some important descriptive details that are consistently mentioned in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 4"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a \"white car\" and a \"fire hydrant,\" which are relevant to some of the ground truth captions. However, it inaccurately states that the car is \"driving down a street,\" while all the ground truths indicate that the car is \"parked.\" Additionally, the generated caption omits the key detail of rain, which is a central element in all ground truth descriptions. While it includes some relevant objects, the core action (driving vs. parked) and a key contextual element (rain) are missing or incorrect, leading to a moderate level of relevance with notable omissions.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption accurately captures the main subject (a white car) and the key setting (a rain-soaked street). It aligns with several of the ground truth captions, which also describe a white car parked on a rainy street. However, it omits some additional contextual elements present in the ground truth, such as the car being seen through a window, the presence of a building and fire hydrant, and the intensity of the rain (e.g., \"pouring\"). While the caption is clear and relevant, it lacks some of the finer contextual and environmental details that are included in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption accurately describes a white car parked in the rain, which aligns with multiple ground truth captions. It also includes the detail of a green fire hydrant, which is mentioned in one of the ground truths (\"A car parked in front of a building and fire hydrant in the rain.\"). While the caption does not include the building or the rain-soaked window mentioned in other ground truths, it captures the key elements and context from the most relevant ones. The description is specific and largely aligned with the overall meaning conveyed by the ground truths, with only minor omissions.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption correctly identifies the main subject (a white car) and the action (parked) and provides a general setting (city street). However, it lacks specific details present in the ground truth captions such as the presence of rain, a building, and a fire hydrant. The omission of the rain, which is a key element in most of the ground truth captions, reduces the alignment with the overall meaning conveyed by the set. The caption is moderately relevant and informative but misses several important contextual elements.\nTotal rating: 3"
