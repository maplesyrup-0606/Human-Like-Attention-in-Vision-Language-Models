    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the main idea of the ground truth captions, which all describe two sheep in a grassy field looking toward the camera. The caption correctly identifies the number of sheep (two), their position (laying in the grass), and even adds a detail about their color (white), which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truths but is not contradictory. However, it omits a key detail present in several ground truths: the sheep looking toward the camera. This omission prevents it from being fully aligned with the overall meaning conveyed by the ground truths. Therefore, it is mostly relevant and detailed but misses a notable aspect.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Two sheep sitting on grass\" captures the general idea of the ground truth captions, which all describe two sheep in a grassy field looking toward the camera. However, it lacks some key details such as the specific posture (\"laying\" vs. \"sitting\"), the expression (\"surprised look\") and the camera interaction (\"look towards the camera\"). The caption is understandable and moderately informative but misses finer details that are consistently mentioned in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Man taking selfie in front of mirror in motorcycle\" captures the general idea of a man using a mirror to take a picture of himself, which is consistent with the ground truth captions. It correctly identifies the main subject (a man), the action (taking a selfie), and the context (a motorcycle mirror). However, it lacks some specific details present in the ground truth, such as the use of a cell phone, the location (remote area), and the exact positioning (rear view or side mirror). The caption is mostly relevant and includes key elements, but minor omissions prevent it from being fully detailed and aligned with the ground truth.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a man taking a selfie with a mirror, which is somewhat aligned with the general theme of the ground truth captions (a man taking a picture in a mirror). However, it fails to capture key contextual elements such as the motorcycle, the car, or the remote area mentioned in the ground truths. Additionally, the mention of \"tall grass\" is not supported by any of the ground truth captions and introduces an irrelevant detail. While the action of taking a picture in a mirror is present, the lack of specificity and the omission of important contextual details reduce the alignment with the ground truths. Therefore, the caption is moderately relevant but lacks completeness and accuracy.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the general idea of a person taking a picture of themselves in a mirror, which is consistent with the main theme of the ground truth captions. However, it introduces an irrelevant detail about the setting\u2014specifically, \"sitting in the grass near a lake\"\u2014which is not mentioned in any of the ground truths. The actual context in the ground truths is about a car or motorcycle mirror, not a mirror in a natural outdoor setting. While the core action is correct, the lack of alignment with the specific setting and the addition of incorrect contextual information reduce the overall relevance and accuracy. The caption is understandable and partially relevant but lacks key details and includes inaccuracies.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"A man using a mirror to take a selfie\" captures the general idea present in several ground truth captions, which all describe a man using a mirror (from a motorcycle or car) to take a picture of himself. It correctly identifies the key action (taking a selfie) and the use of a mirror. However, it lacks specific details mentioned in the ground truths, such as the context of being in a remote area, the use of a cell phone, and the specific type of mirror (e.g., motorcycle side mirror or rearview mirror).

    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Bicycle parked outside a building with graffiti on the wall\" captures the general idea of the scene described in the ground truth captions. It correctly identifies the presence of a bicycle and a building with graffiti, which are key elements mentioned in several ground truths. However, it lacks some specific details such as the color of the bicycle (red), the chained aspect in one caption, and the barred window in another. While the caption is informative and relevant, it misses some finer details that are present in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption accurately describes a red bicycle and its location outside a building with graffiti on the door. It captures key elements present in multiple ground truth captions, such as the color of the bicycle (\"red\"), the presence of the building, and the graffiti-covered door. While it doesn't mention every detail (e.g., the bike being chained, the barred window, or the stucco material), it conveys the main idea in a detailed and coherent manner. The caption is mostly aligned with the ground truths and includes relevant attributes and relationships.  \nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a red bike, which is a key element present in most of the ground truth captions. It also describes the bike as being \"under a doorway,\" which aligns with the idea of the bike being near or against a building, as seen in the ground truths. However, it lacks some important details such as the presence of graffiti on the door, the stucco texture of the building, and the fact that the bike is chained in some descriptions. While it captures the general scene and a few key elements, it omits several important details that are consistently mentioned in the ground truth captions. Therefore, it is mostly relevant and includes some detail, but not all.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a \"graffiti covered doorway\" and \"a building,\" which are present in some of the ground truth captions. However, it omits the key element of the bicycle, which is central to all the ground truth descriptions. While the description of the doorway and building is somewhat accurate, the absence of the bicycle significantly reduces its relevance. The caption is understandable but lacks critical details that define the scene according to the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption is moderately relevant as it correctly identifies the main elements: a dog and a wire basket on a bicycle. However, it misplaces the basket on the \"back\" of the bicycle, while the ground truth captions consistently state that the basket is on the \"front.\" Additionally, the color of the bicycle (blue) and the context (next to bleachers or steps) are not mentioned. The caption captures the general idea but lacks accuracy in key details and misses important contextual elements.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Dog sitting inside a wire basket on a cart\" is somewhat relevant to the ground truth captions, as it captures the main subject (a dog) and a basket. However, it misidentifies the \"bicycle\" as a \"cart,\" which is a significant inaccuracy given that the color and positioning relative to the bleachers or steps are important in the ground truth. Additionally, the generated caption lacks specific details like the color of the bicycle or the fact that it is leaning against or parked next to bleachers. The term \"wire basket\" is also not explicitly mentioned in the ground truths, though it is somewhat close to \"black basket.\" Overall, the caption captures a general idea but lacks key details and contains inaccuracies.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a dog in a cage on the back of a bike, but the ground truth captions consistently describe a dog in a basket mounted on the front of a blue bicycle. The generated caption incorrectly places the basket/cage on the back of the bike rather than the front, and the term \"bike-cart\" is not aligned with the simple basket described in the ground truths. While the general idea of a dog on a bicycle is present, the key details are inaccurate or misaligned with the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption is moderately relevant to the ground truth captions. It correctly identifies a small dog sitting in a bike basket and mentions the general setting being outside, which is consistent with the bleachers or baseball field mentioned in the ground truths. However, it lacks specific details such as the color of the bike (blue), the black basket, and the exact positioning next to bleachers or steps. While it captures the general idea of a dog in a bike basket, it omits several key attributes and relationships described in the ground truth captions.\n\nTotal rating: 3"
