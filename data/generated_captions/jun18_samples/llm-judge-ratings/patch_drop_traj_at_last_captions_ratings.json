    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions an orange tube covering over two benches and a tree, which is somewhat related to the ground truth captions that describe park benches in various settings. However, the generated caption lacks alignment with the specific details found in the ground truths, such as the presence of three benches, their arrangement (facing each other), and the orange and pink walls or a canopy/pavilion. The mention of an orange tube covering is not reflected in the ground truths, and the description is too vague and incomplete to capture the overall meaning. It is somewhat relevant but misses most key elements.\n\nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions \"benches\" and their colors (\"colorful, painted black and brown\"), which is not directly mentioned in the ground truth captions, but it introduces a detail not present in the ground truths. It also adds a \"large tree,\" which is not mentioned in any of the ground truth captions. While the general concept of benches is present, the location is mismatched\u2014none of the ground truths mention a tree or a specific arrangement of benches by a tree.
