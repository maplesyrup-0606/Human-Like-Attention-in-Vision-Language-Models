    "Evaluation: The generated caption correctly identifies the main subject (an old toilet) and mentions the brown floor, which aligns with one of the ground truth captions. However, it lacks several important details such as the blue and white color scheme, the presence of a blue tank, and the plumbing or pipe mentioned in multiple ground truths. While it captures the general idea and a basic attribute, it is not rich in detail and misses key elements that are present in the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a toilet and a tank, which are present in several ground truth captions. However, it omits important details such as the toilet being very low to the ground, the blue and white color scheme, and the brown floor. Additionally, the mention of a \"cover on the tank\" is not confirmed in the ground truths. The caption is somewhat relevant but lacks sufficient detail and accuracy to fully align with the ground truths.  \nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a toilet in a bathroom, which is consistent with the ground truth captions. However, it introduces the detail of a \"tiled bathroom\" and a \"raised base,\" which are not present in any of the ground truth captions. In fact, the ground truths emphasize that the toilet is \"very low to the ground\" and not on a raised base. This misalignment with key descriptive elements (such as the toilet's height and the absence of a raised base) reduces the relevance and accuracy of the generated caption. It captures the general subject (a toilet in a bathroom) but lacks alignment with the specific details present in the ground truth descriptions.\n\nTotal rating: 2",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption mentions a toilet and a pipe, which are present in some of the ground truth captions. However, it lacks specific details such as the toilet's color (blue and white), its low height to the ground, and the context of the bathroom or brown floor. Additionally, the term \"dirty\" is not mentioned in any of the ground truths and introduces an inaccurate detail. The caption is somewhat relevant but lacks sufficient detail and accuracy to be considered more than minimally relevant.\n\nTotal rating: 2"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption \"Buildings and cars in the square with people walking.\" captures the general urban scene described in the ground truth captions. It mentions the presence of buildings, cars, and people, which are key elements found in multiple ground truth captions. However, it lacks specific details such as the brick-paved street with a unique design, the presence of bicyclists, and the description of a group of men on the street.

    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the general urban scene described in the ground truth captions, including a city street, a biker, a building, and people walking. It aligns well with several ground truths, such as \"Urban downtown city center with a bicyclist and pedestrians\" and \"A city view with buildings, bikers and walkers.\" However, it does not mention the group of men explicitly mentioned in one of the ground truths, nor does it reflect the detail about the brick-paved street with a unique design. The caption is mostly relevant and includes several key elements, but it lacks some specific details found in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the general urban setting and mentions people walking, which aligns with some of the ground truth captions. However, it omits key elements such as the presence of men standing on the side of the street, the brick-paved street with a unique design, and the presence of bikers and vehicles. Additionally, the mention of the sky being blue and clear is not relevant to the ground truth descriptions, which focus on the street and its surroundings rather than the sky. The caption is somewhat informative but lacks completeness and specific details that are present in the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption captures the general idea of an urban city scene with tall buildings and people walking, which aligns with several of the ground truth captions. It mentions key elements such as \"city,\" \"buildings,\" and \"people walking,\" which are consistent with multiple ground truth descriptions. However, it lacks specific details mentioned in the ground truths, such as the brick-paved street with a unique design, the presence of bikes or bicyclists, and the variety of people in different modes of transportation (cars, bikes, walking). While the caption is informative and relevant, it is not fully detailed or aligned with the combined meaning of the ground truths.\n\nTotal rating: 3"

    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes a large bathroom and includes several key elements such as a tub, sinks, and a television, which are mentioned in the ground truth captions. However, it adds a \"shower\" and a \"toilet,\" which are not explicitly mentioned in any of the ground truth captions. Additionally, it omits some specific details such as the white color of the tub and cabinets, the black pattern on the floor, and the large tiled area mentioned in the ground truths. While the general idea is captured, the caption lacks some important details and includes some elements not present in the ground truths. Therefore, it is mostly relevant but not fully aligned in terms of completeness and accuracy.\n\nTotal rating: 4",
    "Evaluation: The generated caption describes a bathroom with a large bathtub and marble tile floors. This aligns with several elements from the ground truth captions, such as the presence of a large bathtub and the tiled floor (though the color \"white\" is not explicitly mentioned). However, it omits other key details such as the sinks, lights, television, and the black pattern on the floor, which are mentioned in multiple ground truth captions. The caption is informative and captures a part of the overall scene but lacks the richness and completeness seen in the ground truths. Therefore, it falls into the \"Moderately Relevant and Informative\" category.\n\nTotal rating: 3",
