While the caption refers to the bird as \"small\" and \"golden-winged,\" these are not exact matches to the ground truth attributes. The term \"golden-winged\" is not a recognized attribute from the ground truth (which specifies \"has_wing_color::grey\"), and \"small\" is a general size description, not the specific \"small_(5_-_9_in)\" from the ground truth.

    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: None\nFalse Negatives: 43\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption mentions that the bird is \"brown\" and \"perched atop a tree branch,\" which corresponds to the attributes `has_primary_color::brown` and `has_shape::perching-like`, respectively. This results in **1 True Positive**.\n\nHowever, the caption does not mention most of the other attributes, such as bill shape, wing colors, underparts colors, breast pattern, head pattern, eye color, bill length, etc. Therefore, **43 False Negatives** are recorded.\n\nThere are **no False Positives** because the caption does not include any attributes that are not present in the ground truth. The caption is descriptive of the scene and the bird's general appearance but omits most of the specific visual attributes listed in the ground truth."
