    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 28\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption describes a bird as \"gray\" and mentions the bird is perched on a tree with red flowers, but it does not capture any of the detailed attributes listed in the ground truth. The ground truth includes a wide range of specific features such as colors (buff, red, grey, blue, purple, etc.), patterns (striped, spotted), bill shape and length, tail shape, and other physical characteristics. None of these are explicitly mentioned in the caption, resulting in a complete absence of true positives. Since no attributes are incorrectly mentioned, there are no false positives. All 28 attributes from the ground truth are missed, leading to 28 false negatives."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 28\n```\n\n**Reason for the results:**\n\nThe caption provided is a general and descriptive scene involving a \"small seagull\" flying over water, with additional birds nearby. However, it does **not mention any of the specific bird attributes** listed in the ground truth. The ground truth includes detailed characteristics such as bill shape, wing color, body patterns, coloration of various body parts, and more. \n\nFor example, the caption does not mention:\n- The dagger-shaped bill\n- Grey and white coloration of wings, back, and underparts\n- The forked tail\n- The capped head pattern\n- The orange coloration of the bill and legs\n- The bird's medium size (9\u201316 inches)\n- The gull-like shape\n- The solid breast pattern and belly pattern\n- The black forehead and nape\n\nSince none of the specific attributes are captured or implied in the caption, all 28 attributes are considered **False Negatives**. There are **no True Positives** because no attributes were correctly mentioned. Additionally, there are **no False Positives** because the caption does not mention any attributes that contradict or are not in the ground truth."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 28\n```\n\n**Reason for the results:**\n\nThe caption does not explicitly mention any of the 28 ground truth attributes related to the bird's physical characteristics (e.g., color of body parts, bill shape, wing shape, etc.). Instead, it describes the scene in a general and interpretive way, focusing on the setting (a tree branch, the sky, the bird's posture) and the bird's behavior (looking ahead with curiosity, resting). \n\nWhile the caption mentions the bird is \"gray and white,\" this is not sufficient to count as a true positive since it does not align with the detailed ground truth attributes (e.g., the bird is entirely grey with no white in the ground truth). Therefore, no attributes are correctly mentioned (True Positives = 0), no incorrect attributes are mentioned (False Positives = 0), and all ground truth attributes are missed (False Negatives = 28)."
