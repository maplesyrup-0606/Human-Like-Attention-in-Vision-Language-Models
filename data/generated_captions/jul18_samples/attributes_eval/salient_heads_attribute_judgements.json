The bird is described as \"brown,\" which is not among the ground truth colors (e.g., blue, yellow, orange, etc.).\n  3.

Since \"yellow\" is a dominant color in the description, it is counted as one true positive.\n\n- **False Positives (0):** The caption does not mention any attributes that are not supported by the ground truth. It does not describe features such as bill shape, wing pattern, eye color, etc., so there are no false positives.\n\n- **False Negatives (26):** The majority of the bird's attributes are not captured in the caption. These include details such as the **bill shape**, **wing color**, **tail shape**, **breast pattern**, **head pattern**, **eye color**, **bill length**, **crown color**, **nape color**, **throat color**, **back pattern**, **tail pattern**, **belly pattern**, **leg color**, **bill color**, **primary colors**, and **size and shape**. The caption is general and descriptive of the setting but lacks specific details about the bird's physical characteristics."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 29\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe generated caption provides a general and descriptive scene of a bird but does not mention any of the specific ground truth attributes related to the bird's physical characteristics. The caption does not reference any of the bird's colors (e.g., brown, white), patterns (e.g., striped, solid), body parts (e.g., breast, belly, nape), bill or wing shape, size, or other visual features listed in the ground truth.\n\nWhile the caption mentions \"brown-striped bird\" and \"small,\" these are very general and do not align with the detailed attributes provided in the ground truth (e.g., \"has_underparts_color::brown\", \"has_breast_pattern::striped\", \"has_size::small_(5_-_9_in)\"). Therefore, no attributes are correctly captured (True Positives = 0), no extra attributes are incorrectly mentioned (False Positives = 0), and all 29 ground truth attributes are missed (False Negatives = 29)."

All described features (e.g., colors, possible species) are consistent with the provided attributes.\n\n- **False Negatives (30):**\n  - The caption is very general and lacks specific details about the bird's anatomy and coloration. Many specific attributes are not mentioned, such as the `has_bill_shape::needle`, `has_breast_pattern::striped`, `has_underparts_color::black`, `has_eye_color::black`, `has_wing_shape::tapered-wings`, and many others. These are all part of the ground truth but are omitted in the caption, leading to a high number of false negatives."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 25\n```\n\n**Reason for the results:**\n\nThe caption provides a general scene description of a bird in a rural setting, mentioning the bird's brown feathers and the environment (grassy field, dried grass, countryside). However, it does not mention any of the specific bird attributes listed in the ground truth. These include detailed physical features such as:\n\n- Bill shape, color, and length\n- Wing color and shape\n- Tail shape and color\n- Head, breast, belly, and nape patterns and colors\n- Eye color\n- Size and shape\n- Primary color\n\nSince none of the specific attributes are directly mentioned or described in the caption, all 25 attributes in the ground truth are considered **False Negatives**. There are no **True Positives** because the caption does not accurately reflect any of the specific bird features. There are also no **False Positives**, as the caption does not mention any attributes that contradict the ground truth."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 33\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe caption provides a general description of the bird being small and perched on a thin branch, which aligns with the ground truth attribute `has_size::small_(5_-_9_in)` and `has_shape::perching-like`. Therefore, this counts as **1 True Positive**.\n\nHowever, the caption does **not mention any of the color, pattern, or structural attributes** of the bird (e.g., bill shape, wing color, striped patterns, etc.), even though these are all explicitly provided in the ground truth. This results in **33 False Negatives**.\n\nThere are **no False Positives** because the caption does not mention any attributes that are not present in the ground truth. It focuses on general observations (e.g., size, posture, setting) rather than specific visual features like color or pattern."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 28\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives: 0**  \n  The caption does not correctly mention any of the attributes listed in the ground truth. For example, it describes the bird as \"dark blue,\" which is not one of the true attributes (the bird is described as black in multiple color-related attributes). It also mentions the bird is \"small,\" which is partially correct, but the ground truth specifies a size range of \"small (5 - 9 in),\" and the caption does not include this detail. Therefore, no attributes are accurately captured.\n\n- **False Positives: 1**  \n  The caption mentions the bird is \"dark blue,\" which is not present in the ground truth attributes. The bird is described as being black in all color-related attributes, so this is a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives: 28**  \n  The ground truth contains 28 attributes, most of which are not mentioned in the caption. These include all the black color attributes, bill shape, tail shape, patterns, eye colors, leg colors, etc. The caption focuses on the bird's size and environment rather than the bird's physical characteristics, which are the main focus of the ground truth."
