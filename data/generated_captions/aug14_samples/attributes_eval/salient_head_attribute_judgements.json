    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 1\nFalse Negatives: 20\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\n- **True Positives: 0** \u2013 The caption does not correctly mention any of the ground truth attributes. For example, it refers to the beak as \"orange,\" while the ground truth states the bill color is \"red.\" Additionally, the caption does not describe the bird's shape, size, or color patterns as specified in the attributes.\n\n- **False Positives: 1** \u2013 The mention of an \"orange beak\" is a false positive because it is not part of the ground truth, which specifies the bill color as \"red.\"\n\n- **False Negatives: 20** \u2013 The caption fails to mention numerous ground truth attributes, including the bird's small size, pigeon-like shape, black and white coloration of the underparts, breast, throat, and back, the red bill, the white eye color, the multi-colored breast pattern, and the short bill length relative to the head. These are all part of the ground truth but are not captured in the caption."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 30\n```\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe caption does not mention any of the specific attributes related to the bird's physical characteristics (e.g., color, shape, size, patterns, etc.). Instead, it focuses on the general scene, such as the bird perching on a branch and the background bushes. While the caption does correctly identify the bird as \"small,\" it does not explicitly state the size range (`small_(5_-_9_in)`), and even if it were counted, it would still be a very minimal match.\n\nAll 30 ground truth attributes are related to specific visual features of the bird (e.g., color of body parts, bill shape, wing shape, etc.) that are completely omitted from the caption. Since none of the attributes are mentioned, there are no true positives or false positives."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 1\nFalse Positives: None\nFalse Negatives: 38\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- **True Positives (1):** The caption correctly mentions that the bird is **\"small\"**, which aligns with the ground truth attribute `has_size::small_(5_-_9_in)`.\n\n- **False Positives (None):** The caption does not mention any attributes that are not present in the ground truth. All the information provided in the caption (e.g., \"perched on a tree branch,\" \"tilted head,\" \"puddle of water,\" \"grassy area\") is about the scene and environment, not about the bird's physical attributes, and thus does not introduce any false positives in the context of the bird's characteristics.\n\n- **False Negatives (38):** The caption fails to mention a large number of the bird's physical attributes that are present in the ground truth. These include details about the bird's **bill shape and color**, **wing color and shape**, **tail shape and color**, **body coloration**, **patterns**, **eye color**, **leg color**, **crown color**, etc. The caption is more focused on the bird's **behavior** (tilted head) and **environment** (tree branch, puddle, grassy area) rather than the **visual characteristics** of the bird itself.\n\nOverall, the caption provides a descriptive and contextual scene but does not accurately reflect the detailed physical attributes of the bird as described in the ground truth."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 25\n```\n\n**Reason for the results:**\n\nThe provided caption describes the setting and general appearance of the scene (e.g., a small bird perched on a rock near water), but it does **not mention any of the specific visual attributes** of the bird listed in the ground truth. These attributes include detailed descriptions of color (e.g., grey wings, white underparts), shape (e.g., dagger-shaped bill), patterns (e.g., solid breast), and other physical features.\n\nSince the caption does not explicitly or implicitly refer to any of the 25 ground truth attributes, all of them are considered **false negatives**. There are **no true positives** because none of the attributes were correctly captured, and there are **no false positives** because the caption does not mention any attributes that contradict or go beyond the ground truth."
