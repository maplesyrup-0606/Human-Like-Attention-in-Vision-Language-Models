The caption uses vague descriptors like \"brown and black bird\" and \"wings spread slightly,\" which do not correspond to the precise attributes listed.\n\n- **False Positives: 0** \u2014 The caption does not mention any attributes that contradict the ground truth. It is not adding incorrect information, but it also fails to capture the correct details.\n\n- **False Negatives: 29** \u2014 The caption omits all 29 of the ground truth attributes.

Therefore, there are no true positives.\n\n- **False Positives: 2**  \n  The caption describes the bird as \"small\" and \"brown and white.\" However, the ground truth attributes state the bird is \"very small\" and has a \"primary color\" of \"grey\" and \"yellow,\" not \"brown and white.\" Thus, the size is somewhat accurate but not specific enough to be considered a true positive, and the color description is incorrect, making it a false positive. The mention of \"perched on a branch\" is not an attribute of the bird itself but rather a contextual detail, so it is not counted as a false positive in this analysis.\n\n- **False Negatives: 30**  \n  The ground truth contains 30 specific attributes (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes), and the caption fails to mention any of them.
