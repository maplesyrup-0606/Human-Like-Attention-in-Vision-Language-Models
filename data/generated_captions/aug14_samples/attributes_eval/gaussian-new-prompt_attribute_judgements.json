    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 3\nFalse Negatives: 33\n```\n\n**Reason for the results:**\n\n- **True Positives (0):** None of the attributes in the ground truth are accurately reflected in the caption. For example, while the caption mentions \"grayish-brown color,\" it is a vague and incorrect generalization of the bird's complex and specific coloration attributes (e.g., multiple parts being grey or black). The caption does not accurately describe any of the specific attributes like bill shape, wing color, tail shape, or body pattern.\n\n- **False Positives (3):** The caption mentions some attributes that are not present in the ground truth:\n  - \"Long tail\" \u2014 the ground truth specifies a \"fan-shaped tail,\" not a long one.\n  - \"Large beak\" \u2014 the ground truth states the bill is \"shorter than the head,\" not large.\n  - \"Eyes closed\" \u2014 the ground truth mentions \"black eyes,\" but there is no indication the eyes are closed.\n\n- **False Negatives (33):** The caption completely misses a large number of detailed attributes present in the ground truth, including:\n  - Bill shape and color\n  - Wing color and pattern\n  - Upperparts, underparts, breast, back, tail, and belly color and pattern\n  - Head pattern\n  - Eye color\n  - Size and shape\n  - Leg color\n  - Primary color\n  - Throat and nape color\n\nThe caption is overly general and introduces incorrect details, while failing to capture the precise and rich visual attributes described in the ground truth."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 49\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe provided caption, \"A bird perched on a twig in the midst of bushes,\" only describes the bird's general setting and posture. It does not mention any of the specific visual attributes listed in the ground truth (e.g., colors, patterns, bill shape, wing shape, etc.). Since none of the detailed attributes are captured in the caption, there are no true positives. Additionally, since the caption does not introduce any attributes that are not in the ground truth, there are no false positives. However, all 49 ground truth attributes are not mentioned in the caption, resulting in a high number of false negatives."

    "```\nTrue Positives: 0\nFalse Positives: 0\nFalse Negatives: 24\n```\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe caption does not mention any specific visual attributes of the bird such as color (e.g., brown, grey, black, buff), patterns (e.g., striped, spotted, solid), shape (e.g., notched tail, perching-like), or size (e.g., very small). Instead, it focuses on the bird's environment (wooden log, leaves, wooded area) and its general behavior or appearance (relaxed, owl-like). Since the task is to evaluate how well the caption captures the **ground truth attributes** (which are all visual and specific to the bird's appearance), **none of the attributes are correctly mentioned**. Therefore, there are no true positives. There are also no false positives because the caption does not mention any attributes that contradict the ground truth. All 24 attributes in the ground truth are not mentioned, resulting in 24 false negatives."

While the caption describes a bird with \"yellow and brown feathers,\" it does not specify the exact attributes such as bill shape, underparts color, breast pattern, or other detailed features like throat color, eye color, or bill length. \n\nThe caption is more general in nature, describing the bird's presence in the scene and its visual appeal, rather than capturing the precise physical characteristics provided in the ground truth. Therefore, there are no true positives. Since no attributes were mentioned that contradict the ground truth, there are no false positives. All 19 attributes from the ground truth are not mentioned in the caption, resulting in false negatives."

The caption is very general and does not capture any of the detailed visual features listed in the ground truth.\n\nIn summary, the caption is overly generic and fails to describe the specific visual characteristics of the bird.

The caption does not describe any physical characteristics of the bird that match the provided attributes.\n\n- **False Positives (1):** The caption describes the bird as \"large,\" which contradicts the ground truth attribute that specifies the bird is \"small (5 - 9 in).\" This mismatch constitutes a false positive since the caption mentions a trait that is not consistent with the ground truth.\n\n- **False Negatives (7):** The caption completely omits all the ground truth attributes: bill shape (dagger), bill length (longer than head), size (small), shape (tree-clinging-like), and the color attributes (black, white, black bill). Since these are all part of the ground truth and not reflected in the caption, they are all false negatives.\n\nOverall, the caption is more focused on the setting and behavior of the bird (e.g., perching on a power line, looking at its feet, and coexistence with another bird) rather than on the specific physical attributes provided in the ground truth."
