The ground truth captions consistently mention specific features such as an orange or bright orange beak, white eyes or eye rings, webbed feet, a black or grey body, and various head features like a mohawk-shaped feather or a black plume. In contrast, the generated caption describes a bird with a black beak, no mention of webbed feet, white eyes, or the distinctive coloration and head features described in the ground truth. The generated caption also shifts focus to the setting (rocks near the ocean) and the bird's behavior (looking for food or surveying), which are not part of the visual content described in the ground truth.
